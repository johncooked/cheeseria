# PZ Cheeseria

## Overview

This repository contains the code for the coding challenge.

## Tech Stack

-   Frontend: React.js
-   Backend: Express.js
-   Database: SQLite with Sequelize
-   Other: Docker, Bootstrap, Swagger

## Summary of Improvements if I Had More Time

-   State Management Optimization: Consider creating an initial state object or breaking down state into smaller components for better manageability and scalability.
-   Component Refinement: Further refine components and their relationships through better planning to ensure efficient data flow and component design.
-   Modal Refinement: Explore alternative modal designs such as off-canvas components triggered by floating side buttons to enhance user interaction and allow for multiple cheese selection and price calculation.
-   Data Enrichment: Expand the cheese data model to include additional details like description, country of origin, and common recipes, enabling the transformation of the application into a multipage one.
-   User Experience Enhancement: Improve user experience by reducing reliance on modals and providing users with comprehensive cheese information on separate pages, enhancing exploration and engagement.
-   Feature Expansion: Introduce features like search, filtering, and sorting based on enriched cheese data, further enhancing usability and functionality.
-   API Key Protection: If the application were to use a paid API key, I would implement mechanisms to protect the key, avoiding hardcoding it within the application. Techniques such as environment variables, server-side authentication, or token-based authentication could be explored to securely manage and utilize the API key, ensuring its confidentiality and integrity.
